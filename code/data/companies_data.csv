However, the current gold standard diagnostics can only measure pulmonary capacity as an average over the entire lung.  As a result, a diagnosis can often come too late because for a loss of lung function to even be measurable, the disease must be well-advanced.Now, for the first time in medical history, the capacity to simply, safely and effectively view and measure regional lung function is here.We are 4DMedical - the medical technology company responsible for the XV Lung Ventilation Analysis Software - the breakthrough lung imaging technology that quantitatively measures the patterns of regional lung function in a four-dimensional and highly visual manner.","Carlton, Victoria",51-200,112,2012,2,4D Lung Imaging and Regional Quantitative Analysis,,95

Research on these cells has demonstrated a number of unique properties in them, highlighting their extraordinary suitability for medical applications. These properties, in combination with safe collection, ethical agreeability, tissues and high cell counts harbour the promise of the exciting journey we have started pushing medical boundaries. The science and research behind the discoveries on which the company is based has been carried out within the realms of the reputable Lund University in southern Sweden, one of its prime research centers BMC (Bio Medical Center) Research Center, and the university hospital in Lund. Therefore, Amniotics considers itself today to be uniquely positioned to translate stem cell technologies into novel and improved human therapeutics.Our ultimate vision is to contribute to the successful treatment of serious human diseases by providing the very best cells for various regenerative medical applications. The fact that our cells are of neonatal source (and safely retrieved from the amniotic fluid from C-sections), means that they have greater genome integrity. And also other positive attributes of the neonatal source of our cells makes them superior to traditional sources of stem cells that are currently in therapeutic use. As part of our commitment to providing the best cell therapeutics we are developing these for treatments  with high unmet needs in collaboration with international renowned KOLs and partners. In a nutshell, we have designed and built a complete ecosystem for managing these cells in a safe, secure and controlled manner, which we are now expanding and scaling up. Our journey continues.

https://brainchipinc.com/,2022-02-01 18:33:58.858639,Computer Hardware,BrainChip Holdings Ltd,"BrainChip is a global technology company that has developed a revolutionary advanced neural networking processor that brings artificial intelligence to the edge in a way that existing technologies are not capable. The solution is high performance, small, ultra-low power and enables a wide array of edge capabilities that include local training, learning and inference. The Company markets an innovative event-based neural network processor that is inspired by the spiking nature of the human brain and implements the network processor in an industry standard digital process. By mimicking brain processing BrainChip has pioneered a spiking neural network, called AkidaTM, which is both scalable and flexible to address the requirements in edge devices. At the edge, sensor inputs are analyzed at the point of acquisition rather than transmission to the cloud or a datacenter. Akida is designed to provide a complete ultra-low power AI Edge Network for vision, audio and smart transducer applications. The reduction in system latency provides faster response and a more power efficient system that can reduce the large carbon footprint datacenters.

At Global Trac Solutions we are integrating media, creativity, and technology to develop and deploy thought-provoking ideas and solutions that are fostering and transforming the approach to some of society’s most pressing matters. For the better part of the past decade, PSYC was at the forefront of the Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and Financial Technology (“Fintech”) industries and successfully carved-out it’s own niche within the “high-risk” merchant processing sector. In early 2020,  Company leadership initiated a thorough reassessment of the Company’s long-term growth, profitability initiatives, and focus on driving shareholder value. The outcome of this reassessment was the mindful decision to pivot the Company out of the SaaS and Fintech space and strategically redirect it towards the emerging sector of psychedelic medicine in recognizing the shift, on a global scale, we are experiencing with the acceptance of alternative medicines and treatments. As part of this repositioning, the Company, in February 2020, successfully completed the process of filing for and changing it’s long-standing ticker symbol from “GOHE” to “PSYC” with the intent of demonstrating the Company’s commitment of establishing itself as a recognized leader within the psychedelic industry.  In observing a significant and growing need for reputable and fact-driven informational and educational resources during the highly-critical early stages of the industry’s growth, PSYC, through it’s initial digital medial platforms, is focused on developing the industry’s most prominent and trusted hub for news, information, education, and unique thought-provoking perspective.",,02-Oct,2,,,,,65

With the medicinal benefits of cannabis firmly established – and with a global patient market demanding quality cannabis oil – MediPharm Labs was born. While initially exploring options to cultivate cannabis plant, MediPharm Labs came to recognize the opportunity for a select focus on cannabis concentrates. MediPharm Labs set out to master this area of production, and rely on the many cultivating experts to provide quality raw materials.In 2016, MediPharm labs submitted an application to Health Canada for approval to distribute medicinal cannabis oil. Proudly, MediPharm Labs was one of the first Licensed Producer applications in history to apply for license that did not include the cultivation of cannabis.The key to MediPharm Labs’ unrivaled quality is our best possible use of modern technology and innovative extraction techniques. MediPharm Labs produces cannabis oil that is pharmaceutical grade and and meets the specific quality and purity requirements.The team behind MediPharm Labs have proven industry experience in the areas of pharmaceutical extraction, processing and quality assurance.In 2018, MediPharm Labs is gearing up to commence distribution to our Health Canada approved business partners and make history. The response has been enormous, positive and heartening. Medicinal cannabis has arrived – and through our partners we will provide patients with access to pure, consistent and safe cannabis oil.MediPharm Labs commenced construction of a world-class extraction facility in Australia in June 2018. MediPharm Labs Australia is a subsidiary of MediPharm Labs Inc. and the companies’ first expansion outside of Canada. MediPharm Labs Australia completed its application process with the federal Office of Drug Control in February 2018 to extract and import medical cannabis products in Australia.

For the next two decades it continued as a highly successful subsidiary of Pfizer Corporation. However, by the late 1990s the focus of Pfizer had shifted from formulations to research. In accordance with this transformation, Pfizer divested its interests in many countries, including Bangladesh. Specifically, in 1993 Pfizer transferred the ownership of its Bangladesh operations to local shareholders, and the name of the company was changed to Renata Limited. In a gesture of corporate charity, Pfizer donated shares so that, along with a partial payment from the SAJIDA Foundation, 51% ownership of Renata Limited would be held by the Foundation.  Today SAJIDA’s microfinance and micro-insurance programs support over 107,120 members and their families; thus far cumulative loan disbursement totals BDT 5,750 million. Currently, SAJIDA’s health program covers over 1 million beneficiaries by delivering services through two 70 bed hospitals, panel doctors in SAJIDA’s micro finance branches, and mobile health teams.

The ability to modify genes and use cells as medicines will be one of the most important advances in healthcare over the next several decades.  Sana is building differentiated capabilities across the spectrum of cell and gene therapy.  Three aspirations drive Sana as we look to discover treatments for patients with poor outcomes or currently untreatable diseases. The first is the ability to repair and control the genes in any cell in the body.  We are advancing novel delivery technologies with the goal of being able to deliver any payload to any cell in a specific, predictable, and repeatable manner, paving the way for next-generation in vivo gene therapy.   Next is the ability to differentiate pluripotent stem cells ex vivo into immune-cloaked functional cells with the aspiration of being able to replace any missing or damaged cells in the body.  Last is a belief we can enable broader access to our therapies through focusing on scalable manufacturing solutions, the cost of manufacturing, and aligning with key stakeholders. Sana launched in early 2019 and has approximately two hundred employees in Seattle, Cambridge, and South San Francisco. In 2019, we raised capital to enable our broad vision, began to acquire technology and establish an IP estate across cell and gene therapy, and made significant progress validating our cell and gene therapy platforms.  Growing from this foundation, we intend to push forward our platforms and product pipeline in 2020 and beyond.","Seattle, Washington",201-500,375,2018,3,,"{'Research': '192', 'Business Development': '51', 'Operations': '43', 'Information Technology': '30', 'Engineering': '26', 'Human Resources': '24', 'Legal': '14', 'Community and Social Services': '14', 'Education': '13', 'Administrative': '12', 'Program and Project Management': '10', 'Healthcare Services': '7', 'Accounting': '6', 'Finance': '6', 'Product Management': '6'}",354

Our goal is to empower the scientific community with tools to achieve exceptional scientiﬁc outcomes. We do this by removing the technological barriers that stand between breakthrough ideas and the information that can make them a reality.Over the last 15 years, the fields of genomics and transcriptomics have undergone an explosion in content and discovery, fueled by massively parallel technologies that made large-scale studies possible and tractable. Advancement in those fields have deepened our understanding of biology and ushered in new treatment mechanisms and diagnostics solutions that impact everyday human life.Similar capabilities have evaded the field of proteomics. As a result, researchers have been forced into a tradeoff: the scale of the study, or the depth of its coverage. Until now.We’re committed to eliminating the obstacles that have kept proteomics’ potential from matching the pace of advancements we’ve seen in other fields. We believe that unbiased, deep, rapid, large-scale proteomics can, and must, become accessible to the broad scientific community so that we may significantly advance our understanding of biology, health, and disease.

https://todosmedical.com/,2022-02-02 03:18:29.146606,Biotechnology,Todos Medical Ltd.,"Founded in Rehovot, Israel with offices in New York City, Todos Medical Ltd. (OTCQB: TOMDF) engineers life-saving diagnostic solutions for the early detection of a variety of cancers. The Company's state-of-the-art and patented Todos Biochemical Infrared Analyses (TBIA) is a proprietary cancer-screening technology using peripheral blood analysis that deploys deep examination into cancer's influence on the immune system, looking for biochemical changes in blood mononuclear cells and plasma. Todos' two internally-developed cancer-screening tests, TMB-1 and TMB-2, have received a CE mark in Europe. Todos recently acquired U.S.-based medical diagnostics company Provista Diagnostics, Inc. to gain rights to its Alpharetta, Georgia-based CLIA/CAP certified lab currently performing PCR COVID testing and Provista's proprietary commercial-stage Videssa® breast cancer blood test.Todos is also developing blood tests for the early detection of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. The Lymphocyte Proliferation Test (LymPro Test™) is a diagnostic blood test that determines the ability of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and monocytes to withstand an exogenous mitogenic stimulation that induces them to enter the cell cycle. It is believed that certain diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease, are the result of compromised cellular machinery that leads to aberrant cell cycle re-entry by neurons, which then leads to apoptosis. LymPro is unique in the use of peripheral blood lymphocytes as a surrogate for neuronal cell function, suggesting a common relationship between PBLs and neurons in the brain.Todos has entered into distribution agreements with companies to distribute certain novel coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits. The agreements cover multiple international suppliers of PCR testing kits and related materials and supplies, as well as antibody testing kits from multiple manufacturers after completing validation of said testing kits and supplies.","New York, NY",Nov-50,15,2010,2,"IPO

The app fully launched in November of 2015 and is on the App Store and Google Play. WebSafety's app allows parents to monitor what children are doing on their iOS and Android mobile devices. WebSafety monitor's the following: Apps downloaded, SMS, Websites visited, Social Media for Facebook and Instagram including photos that the child has uploaded. Additionally, WebSafety tracks location and provides for geofencing of the mobile device for notifications when the child enters or leaves predetermined locations and areas. The app also allows the parent to create a curfew which will automatically turn off certain mobile device functions at times as determined by the parent. The parent is notified on either their mobile devices or their desktop/laptop when questionable apps and websites have been downloaded and visited, when vulgar and derogatory language is used or other words of concern including: suicide, gun, hate, drugs, etc., which may be indicative of cyberbullying or other emotional issues that the child has been the subject of or is currently suffering from. The parent will see who the child has been interacting with on Facebook and Instagram and how much time was spent online with the child's contact.The technology is both patented and patent pending.WebSafety's vision is to provide an open window through which concerned parents can monitor questionable and potentially harmful content or a direct predatory exchange occurring on their child's mobile device.The dashboard allows the parent to monitor each child individually and upon receipt of a notification promotes an open discussion to occur in which the parent may discuss and find out what is occurring in the child's lifeWebSafety is now marketing and advertising the app nationally.","Los Angeles, California",02-Oct,2,2013,,"Parental Control

According to the World Health Organization, 15 million people suffer stroke worldwide each year. Of these, 5 million die and another 5 million are permanently disabled. Stroke is the third cause of death in the world and the leading cause of death among women. It is also the first cause of adult acquired disabilities resulting from the neurological damages sustained by 75% of the survivors. However only one treatment is presently recommended by health authorities and is it estimated that only 15% of ischemic stroke patients are treated with it, with less that 40% efficacy. So while this treatment is very useful for ischemic stroke, a major need for a new treatment capable of effectively treating a majority of ischemic stroke patients remains.This project is based on the academic research from Acticor Biotech founders Dr. M. Jandrot-Perrus and Prof. P. Billiald. It was supported by top institutions including the ANR (The French National Research Agency), the Fondation de France.The project also won the 2012 national prize for innovation in creation & development category from the BPI (French Public Investment Bank, formerly Oseo).",,Nov-50,30,2013,2,"biotechnology

https://actinogen.com.au/,,Biotechnology,Actinogen Medical Limited,"Actinogen Medical (ASX:ACW) is an ASX-listed biotechnology company developing novel therapies for neurological diseases associated with dysregulated brain cortisol.Actinogen Medical’s lead compound, Xanamem®, has been specifically designed to reduce production of intracellular cortisol - the stress hormone - through the inhibition of the 11β-HSD1 enzyme in the brain. The 11β-HSD1 enzyme is highly concentrated in the areas of the brain associated with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, potentially linked to cognitive impairment and anxiety in Fragile X syndrome, and cognitive impairment in other diseases. Because of its ability to reach these areas of the brain and inhibit this enzyme, Xanamem is very different from other treatments for cognitive impairment. There is a strong association between persistent stress and the production of excess cortisol that leads to changes in the brain affecting memory, cognitive function, behaviour and neuropsychological symptoms.Actinogen’s clinical programme to date has demonstrated the safety and tolerability of Xanamem once daily in more than 200 healthy elderly volunteers and patients with Alzheimer’s disease. A statistically significant improvement was observed on computerised cognition testing. These results, along with other data recently generated, confirm 11β-HSD1 inhibition by Xanamem as a promising potential treatment for cognitive impairment.The Company plans to initiate Phase II studies of Xanamem in various disease areas in 2021. The XanaMIA study is planned to be conducted in two parts and is designed to study improvements in cognitive ability in older volunteers, and in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease.

Cancer cells usually evade the immune system, for example by producing immunosuppressive substances. Thus, although tumors often contain a large number of immune cells that should be able to attack the cancer cells, they are unable to do so due to the immunosuppression caused by the tumor. With immunotherapy, the ability of the immune system to fight cancer cells is improved in an effective manner, and the defense mechanisms used by the tumor are blocked or weakened. In addition, immune cells capable of destroying the cancer cells will survive in the body and thus protect it from metastases that may arise after treatment has ended. This ""vaccination effect"" is unique for immunotherapy.",,Nov-50,55,2001,,"Immunotherapy of cancer

Annovis is a clinical stage, drug platform company focused primarily on drugs for chronic neurodegeneration—AD, its orphan indication AD-DS and PD. Additionally, we have a compound to treat acute neurodegeneration—traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke—and a third compound for advanced AD.  Our lead compound is ANVS-401, a small, once a day, orally administered, brain penetrant inhibitor of neurotoxic proteins. We believe that ANVS-401 has the potential to be the first drug to interfere with the underlying mechanism of neurodegeneration. The biological activity of ANVS-401 has been evaluated in 19 animal studies conducted in leading institutions such as the Karolinska Institute, Columbia University and Harvard University.  We have also conducted three clinical trials with 125 humans including two safety studies in 120 healthy volunteers and a proof-of-concept study in five MCI patients.  These studies showed that ANVS-401 was well tolerated and we saw promising clinical signals: ANVS-401 reduced and normalized the levels of APP, tau and aSYN (aSYN is an unpublished observation),  - neurotoxic proteins that are the main cause of neurodegeneration -- back to the levels seen in healthy volunteers and statistically lowered inflammation.We are presently conducting a Phase 2a study in AD patients in collaboration with the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) group and plan to initiate a second Phase 2a proof-of-concept study of ANVS-401 in the first quarter of 2020 with 50 PD patients. We believe AD and PD are two of the largest medical needs of the aging U.S. population, and two potentially large markets, once a DMD has been developed and approved.

https://www.appliedmt.com/,,Biotechnology,Applied Molecular Transport Inc.,"Applied Molecular Therapeutics (AMT), a public biopharmaceutical company based in South San Francisco, California,  is committed to developing novel, oral biological therapeutics to treat severe autoimmune, metabolic and inflammatory diseases. AMT is leveraging its propriety technology platforms to create gastrointestinal (GI)-select therapeutics that harness naturally occurring transport and targeting mechanisms to cross the protective barrier of the intestinal epithelium (IE). Once across the IE, the therapeutics gain privileged access to the immune cell-rich environment of the GI tissue as well as the hepatic portal system and downstream systemic circulation.  With this privileged access, AMT’s goal is to develop transformative new oral therapeutic treatment options that offer patients greater efficacy and tolerability than available with today’s therapeutics.   AMT has a robust pipeline of oral biologic product opportunities, including AMT-101 which is currently in Phase 1b clinical development for the treatment of adults with ulcerative colitis (UC).  AMT-101 is a novel, gut-selective, investigational oral biologic fusion protein of interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine.  Derived from AMT’s proprietary platforms, AMT-101 is engineered to cross the selective barrier of  the IE and enhance localized IL-10  directly within the  immune-cell rich environment of GI tissue where up to 75 percent of immune cells reside. This direct targeting of the immune system creates the potential for AMT-101 to address, at its point of origin, the immune dysregulation that gives rise to UC and other inflammatory bowel diseases, and restore immune homeostasis with minimal systemic exposure and potentially fewer adverse events compared to systemic administration of IL-10.   AMT has amassed a broad global IP portfolio surrounding its multiple technology platforms and therapeutic programs.","South San Francisco, CA",51-200,122,2015,,,"{'Research': '50', 'Operations': '25', 'Business Development': '18', 'Quality Assurance': '11', 'Information Technology': '8', 'Community and Social Services': '7', 'Human Resources': '6', 'Education': '5', 'Accounting': '4', 'Healthcare Services': '4', 'Legal': '3', 'Consulting': '3', 'Finance': '2', 'Media and Communication': '2', 'Administrative': '2'}",113

The goal is to treat small ocular melanomas potentially long before the disease progresses and metastasizes to the liver, where it almost always is fatal. Development of a first-in-class, non-radioactive treatment option to selectively destroy cancer cells would create the possibility to transform the treatment of this and other cancers where the disease can be detected early.By enabling physicians to treat cancer more selectively, effectively and safely than they can do today, we aim to eliminate the need for invasive procedures that carry significant morbidity, including vision loss and often do little to improve a patient’s overall survival.","Cambridge, MA",Nov-50,56,2009,,"research

https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/,,Biotechnology,Bicycle Therapeutics plc,"We are Bicycle Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. We didn’t wait for the next advance against cancer. We created it. Based on groundbreaking work conceived in the laboratory of Sir Greg Winter with the help of Professor Christian Heinis, we are pioneering the development of bicyclic peptides, or Bicycles® – a novel class of versatile, chemically synthesized medicines. Bicycles are fully synthetic short peptides constrained to form two loops which stabilize their structural geometry. This constraint is designed to confer high affinity and selectivity, and the relatively large surface area presented by the molecule allows targets to be drugged that have historically been intractable to non-biological approaches. Bicycles represent a unique therapeutic class, combining the pharmacological properties normally associated with a biologic with the manufacturing and pharmacokinetic advantages of a small molecule, yet with no signs of immunogenicity observed to date. Bicycles can be used as Bicycle conjugates to deliver toxin payloads and to precisely target local immune activation within tumors and as Bicycle T-cell modulators, which activate cytotoxic T-cells while circumventing the limitations of antibody and biologic therapies and better enabling combination therapy. Our lead product candidate, BT1718, is a Bicycle toxin conjugate currently being investigated in a Phase I/IIa open label dose escalation and expansion clinical trial sponsored by Cancer Research UK.

We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of protruding and bulging lumbar discs in patients suffering from chronic lumbar disc disease. The BRTX-100 production process involves collecting a patient’s bone marrow, isolating and culturing stem cells from the bone marrow and cryopreserving the cells. In an outpatient procedure, BRTX-100 is to be injected by a physician into the patient’s damaged disc. The treatment is intended for patients whose pain has not been alleviated by non-invasive procedures and who potentially face the prospect of surgery. We have received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial using BRTX-100 to treat chronic lower back pain due to degenerative disc disease related to protruding/bulging discs.• Metabolic Program (ThermoStem®): We are developing a cell-based therapy to target obesity and metabolic disorders using brown adipose (fat) derived stem cells to generate brown adipose tissue (“BAT”). BAT is intended to mimic naturally occurring brown adipose depots that regulate metabolic homeostasis in humans. Initial preclinical research indicates that increased amounts of brown fat in the body may be responsible for additional caloric burning as well as reduced glucose and lipid levels.

https://www.bioviepharma.com/,,Biotechnology,BioVie Inc.,"BioVie Inc. (OTC PINK: BIVI) is developing novel drug therapies for life-threatening complications of chronic liver disease. Our initial target is ascites, which can occur in patients with advanced cirrhosis due to hepatitis, NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis), or alcoholism. Ascites affects about 100,000 Americans and carries an estimated 40% mortality rate within two years of being diagnosed.The Company’s new drug candidate BIV201 is about to enter a Phase 2 clinical trial in the US. It’s based on a drug (terlipressin) not yet available in the US, but approved in about 40 countries for treating related complications of liver cirrhosis. The FDA has never approved a drug to treat ascites and there is a significant unmet medical need for our novel therapy, which has Orphan drug status.BioVie has attracted funding from strategic investors including Aspire Capital, Cuong Do, the global strategy lead for Samsung, and Hari Kumar, founder of Adheron Therapeutics which he sold to Roche for $580 million.The Company has obtained FDA and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals to begin a Phase 2a clinical trial as early as August 2017. The trial design is based on two small overseas investigative studies which had positive results. It will be dosed in a new way as a continuous infusion using an ambulatory pump, which was invented by the Company’s Italian advisor. BioVie has secured US patent coverage for this novel dosing method for ascites and expects to be the first company to introduce terlipressin into the US market.Our goal is for BIV201 to be used by US physicians to keep these patients healthier and save billions of dollars in hospitalization costs. This could create a strong case for reimbursement coverage. Including planned follow-on indications, BioVie believes that BIV201 could potentially generate future US sales revenues exceeding $1 billion annually.For more information about BioVie and BIV201, please visit our website www.biovieinc.com.","Beverly, Massachusetts (MA)",02-Oct,10,2013,,"BioTech

https://www.bivictrix.com/,,Biotechnology,BiVictriX Therapeutics Plc,"BiVictriX is an emerging drug discovery and development company generating a pioneering new class of next-generation anti-cancer therapeutics which exhibit superior selectivity towards the cancer.  Existing antibody-based approaches have shown considerable therapeutic benefit in a number of cancer indications, however the wider application of these drugs to more challenging settings is limited by the shared expression of the targeted antigens on healthy tissues. Thus leading to debilitating and sometimes fatal toxic side-effects associated with treatment. The lack of true cancer specificity seen with existing platforms has resulted in many antibody-based therapeutics being removed from the clinic and is one of the major factors limiting the development of this otherwise promising therapeutic class.BiVictriX's Bi-Cygni therapeutics are engineered to selectively target unique cancer-specific twin antigen fingerprints, which are largely absent from healthy cells. The Bi-Cygni approach links the Company's in-house panel of cancer-restricted twin antigen fingerprints to generate the next generation of bispecific ADC therapeutics with enhanced therapeutic index, across a broad range of malignant indications. The Company's initial focus is on the generation of Bi-Cygni Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs), with future plans to expand the technology to other therapeutic modalities (Cell engagers and CAR-T).","Macclesfield, Cheshire",02-Oct,13,2017,,"Drug Discovery

https://www.contrafect.com/,,Biotechnology,ContraFect Corporation,"We are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of direct lytic agents (DLAs), including lysins and amurin peptides, as new medical modalities for the treatment of life-threatening, antibiotic-resistant infections. An estimated 700,000 deaths worldwide each year are attributed to antimicrobial-resistant infections. We intend to address life threatening infections using our therapeutic product candidates from our platform of DLAs, which include lysins and amurin peptides. Lysins are a new class of DLAs which are recombinantly produced antimicrobial proteins with a novel mechanism of action associated with the rapid killing of target bacteria, eradication of biofilms and synergy with conventional antibiotics. Amurin peptides are a novel class of DLAs which exhibit broad-spectrum activity against a wide range of antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter species. We believe that the properties of our lysins and amurin peptides will make them suitable for targeting antibiotic-resistant organisms, such as MRSA and P. aeruginosa, which can cause serious infections such as bacteremia, pneumonia and osteomyelitis. We have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of Staph aureus bacteremia, including endocarditis, with our lead lysin candidate, exebacase, which is the first lysin to enter clinical studies in the U.S. Exebacase, currently being studied in a pivotal Phase 3 clinical study, was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of MRSA bloodstream infections, including right-sided endocarditis, when used in addition to SOC anti-staphylococcal antibiotics in adult patients.","Yonkers, NY",Nov-50,44,2008,,,,33

Its proprietary ATLAS™ platform can comprehensively profile each patient’s T cell responses to potential targets, or antigens, on that patient’s tumor. ATLAS zeroes in on both antigens that activate anti-tumor T cell responses and inhibitory antigens, InhibigensTM, that drive pro-tumor immune responses. Genocea is conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for GEN-011, an adoptive T cell therapy comprised of neoantigen-targeted peripheral cells.  Also, Genocea continues to monitor patients in its Phase 1/2a GEN-009 neoantigen vaccine clinical trial.  In addition to the two clinical programs, Genocea is conducting research in several areas where we believe ATLAS could be a key tool in optimizing antigen selection for therapies across a number of diseases.","Cambridge, MA",51-200,90,2006,,"Vaccine Development

The novel therapeutic entity HAMLET is formed when the human milk protein alpha-lactalbumin undergoes a conformational change and binds to oleic acid.Advanced technologies allow us to see molecules, measure them from every angle, and understand their deepest secrets. Using such techniques, we were able to identify the structure of HAMLET and especially the domains that are responsible for the killing effect. This is how we identified the Alpha1 peptide, which forms a lipid complex and kills tumor cells. This smaller part of the HAMLET molecule can be produced synthetically, and used as a drug candidate.Development focuses on drugs, which will be used primarily for the treatment and prevention of cancer. HAMLET kills tumor cells, and has proven safe in proof-of-concept studies in animal models. HAMLET has shown a therapeutic effect on skin papillomas in a placebo-controlled clinical trial and injection of HAMLET into the bladders of patients with bladder cancer has caused the shedding of dead cancer cells.

Top medical centers, hospitals and clinics across the United States are now offering this breakthrough treatment for cancer patients.The word brachytherapy derives from the Greek prefix brachy, meaning “short” or “close,” because the titanium capsules containing the radioisotope are implanted directly into the cancerous prostate gland.Treatment of cancer using low dose radiation or “seed” brachytherapy was pioneered in the 1960’s as an effective alternative to radical prostatectomy. Pioneers in brachytherapy research initially theorized about the use of Cesium-131 in a titanium capsule, however scientific and economic limitations at the time prevented its development and Iodine-125 emerged as an alternative.Beginning in 1967, Iodine-125 became the first radioisotope manufactured in a titanium capsule, or seed. While its use continues to this day, many patients and doctors in recent years have chosen Palladium-103, a faster-acting, shorter half-life isotope than Iodine-125. In order to obtain the clinical benefits of Palladium’s short half-life, patients and clinicians were forced to settle for lower energy or tissue penetrating power.A team of scientists continued to believe the physical characteristics of Cesium-131* could potentially provide superior clinical benefits for seed brachytherapy patients. The team developed the patented process for economically separating and purifying Cesium-131 and in 1998 Isoray was founded to manufacture and commercialize Cesium-131 brachytherapy seeds to treat cancers.","Richland, WA",Nov-50,66,1998,,"LDR brachytherapy

Marker’s cell therapy technology is based on the selective expansion of non-engineered, tumor-specific T cells that recognize tumor associated antigens (i.e. tumor targets) and kill tumor cells expressing those targets. Once infused into patients, this population of T cells attacks multiple tumor targets and acts to activate the patient’s immune system to produce broad spectrum anti-tumor activity. Because Marker does not genetically engineer its T cells, when compared to current engineered CAR-T and TCR-based approaches, its products (i) are significantly less expensive and easier to manufacture, (ii) appear to be markedly less toxic, and (iii) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit. As a result, Marker believes its portfolio of T cell therapies has a compelling therapeutic product profile, as compared to current gene-modified CAR-T and TCR-based therapies.  Marker is also advancing a number of innovative peptide- and gene-based immuno-therapeutics for the treatment of cancer and metastatic disease, including our Folate Receptor Alpha program (TPIV200) for breast and ovarian cancers and our HER2/neu+ peptide antigen program (TPIV100/110) in Phase II clinical trials.

The Company’s approach in developing cancer therapies utilizes its expertise in the biology of dendritic cells, which are a type of white blood cell that activate the immune system. The Company’s cancer therapies have been demonstrated in clinical trials to significantly extend both time to recurrence and survival, whilst providing a superior quality of life with no debilitating side effects when compared with current therapies.The Company’s platform technology, DCVax®, uses a patient’s own dendritic cells, the starter engine of the immune system. The dendritic cells are extracted from the body, loaded with tumor biomarkers or ‘‘antigens’’, thereby creating a personalized therapeutic vaccine. Injection of these cells back into the patient initiates a potent immune response against cancer cells, resulting in delayed time to progression and prolonged survival. The Company’s lead product candidate is DCVax®-Brain which targets Glioblastoma Multiforme (‘‘GBM’’), the most lethal form of brain cancer. DCVax®-Brain has entered a Phase II FDA-allowed clinical trial, which is designed and powered as a pivotal trial (i.e. a trial from which a company may go directly to product approval). Following this trial, the Company anticipates filing a biologic license application (or ‘‘BLA’’) with the FDA for DCVax®-Brain.

We have other significant clinical assets to develop, primarily RGN-352 (injectable formulation of Tβ4 for cardiac and CNS/PNS disorders) in the U.S., Pan Asia, and Europe, and RGN-259 in the EU. With respect to RGN-259, our goal is to wait until Phase 3 is completed in the U.S. before moving into the EU with RGN-259 in order to maximize value for the EU market. We intend to continue to develop RGN-352, either by obtaining grants to fund a Phase IIa clinical trial in the cardiovascular or central nervous system fields or finding a suitable partner with the resources and capabilities to develop it as we have with RGN-259.",,02-Oct,8,,,Dry Eye Disease,,3

In 2005, Resverlogix commenced trading on the TSX under the symbol RVX. Resverlogix is a pioneer in the landscape of epigenetics. Today, apabetalone – discovered in 2006 – is the world leader in a new class of drugs designed to regulate gene expression through the inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins. Through this mechanism, we believe we can improve the lives of our patients by restoring biological functions – altered by serious illnesses such as cardiovascular disease – to a healthy state. The prevalence of BET proteins in the human body allows apabetalone to simultaneously target multiple disease-causing biological processes – leading a new paradigm shift in the treatment of chronic disease. Apabetalone is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial – BETonMACE – for the treatment of high-risk cardiovascular disease patients, who also have type 2 diabetes mellitus and low levels of high-density lipoprotein. The current standard of care for these high-risk patients includes the administration of statins, of which, the two most common are Lipitor and Crestor. Despite maximized use, statins only prevent approximately 30% of cardiovascular events within this patient group; the remaining 70% represents a large addressable market for the company.

The company has established a robust product engine that leverages advances in DNA sequencing and CRISPR-based target discovery to generate breakthrough medicines that have the potential to provide deeper, more sustained benefit than today’s targeted therapies, and extend the benefit of available immuno-oncology agents.Tango Therapeutics is focused on three areas of drug development, each in well-defined patient populations currently lacking effective treatment options, and each with hallmarks of cancer that have not been targeted yet. These include: loss of tumor suppressor gene function; multiple oncogenic drivers; and immune evasion.What fuels each of Tango’s programs is an increasingly sophisticated ability to utilize synthetic lethality - the interaction between two genes that causes cell death when both are inactivated. In cancer cells, one of these genes is inactivated by mutation; the other will be inactivated by a drug.  This approach leaves normal cells largely unaffected, with the potential to greatly enhance anti-tumor efficacy and reduce associated toxicity.  Tango’s success will be driven by its depth of understanding of the genetic subtypes of cancer, and corresponding insights into novel drug targets and combinations uniquely relevant to each subtype. By shaping discovery efforts in this way, Tango has the potential to reach the clinic quickly, and with a clear plan for identifying the patients most likely to benefit from each new treatment, an approach that could increase both speed and probability of success in translating novel target discoveries into transformational new medicines for patients.","Cambridge, Massachusetts",51-200,102,2017,,"cancer
